# Rendering React with wasm-quickjs-dom

There are four ways to render a React tree with this package, and they differ by an order of
magnitude. Which one is right depends on where the React code runs.

| Approach | Where React runs | 300-row tree (measured) | Use it for |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Host-driven `react-dom` | Node, DOM in the page | ≈ 90 ms | Tests (Testing Library), incremental updates, event simulation |
| Host-driven + `transact()` | Node, DOM in the page | ≈ 80–95 ms, no faster than the plain commit | Host-driven commits that interleave reads and writes |
| In-page `renderToString` | Inside the page | ≈ 20 ms render, ≈ 22 ms render + parse + serialize | Prerendering / SSR-shaped output: HTML is the product |
| In-page client render (`createRoot`) | Inside the page | ≈ 45 ms render, ≈ 40 ms full-tree update | Running the app itself in the page: interactive state, page scripts, hydration |

Measurements: React 19.3.1, a 300-row tree (1,201 elements + ~600 text nodes: a labelled
span, an `<input defaultValue>`, and a button per row), this machine's medians. The host-driven
numbers use the development `react-dom` build, the in-page numbers the production
`react-dom/server` build. jsdom renders the same tree host-side in ≈ 35–70 ms.

## Why host-driven rendering costs what it costs

Every DOM operation the host performs crosses the bridge once: a property write, a method
call, a read that is not cached. React's commit phase performs thousands of them, and its
individual operations are already near the bridge's floor (≈ 2 µs for a simple write, more for
node creation, whose answer must be wrapped and registered host-side). Steps taken in the
bridge itself — cheaper creation and style paths, dropping repeated writes whose value is
already in the page, and `transact()` — narrow the gap but cannot remove the per-operation
floor. A tree built entirely inside the page pays none of it: the same 3,000-node build that
takes 46–58 ms driven from the host takes ≈ 5 ms in page code.

## Prerendering: run React inside the page

When the deliverable is HTML — an OGP image, a prerendered page, a screenshot — render inside
the page and take the HTML out:

1. Bundle the app with `react-dom/server` for the browser (any bundler; esbuild below).
2. `createDOM` a page, `dom.eval` the bundle once, then call the exported render function per
   request and assign the result with `innerHTML`, or use the returned string directly.
3. `dom.serialize()` (or the string itself) is the output.

```js
// entry.js — bundled and evaluated in the page
const React = require("react");
const { renderToString } = require("react-dom/server");

function App({ rows }) {
  const children = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    children.push(
      React.createElement("div", { className: "row", key: i },
        React.createElement("span", null, "Row " + i),
        React.createElement("input", { defaultValue: "value " + i }),
        React.createElement("button", null, "Save " + i)));
  }
  return React.createElement("div", { className: "app" }, children);
}
globalThis.__renderApp = (rows) => renderToString(React.createElement(App, { rows }));
```

```sh
esbuild entry.js --bundle --format=iife \
  --define:process.env.NODE_ENV='"production"' --outfile=bundle.js
```

```ts
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { createDOM } from "wasm-quickjs-dom";

const bundle = readFileSync("bundle.js", "utf8");
const dom = await createDOM(
  { html: "<!doctype html><body><div id='root'></div></body>", baseUrl: "https://example.com/" },
);
try {
  await dom.eval(bundle); // one-time per page: ≈ 140–210 ms for react + react-dom/server (~590 KB)
  const html = await dom.eval<string>("__renderApp(300)"); // ≈ 20 ms
  // Either use the string as the prerendered output, or parse it into the page
  // (for layout with wasm-html-to-image, screenshots, further page scripts):
  await dom.eval("document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = __renderApp(300)");
  const page = dom.serialize();
} finally {
  dom.close();
}
```

Notes:

- The bundle evaluation is the one real fixed cost. Reuse the page across renders when the
  app allows it, or accept it per render — at 300 rows the whole in-page path, bundle included,
  is still comparable to one host-driven render, and every render after the first is ~4× faster.
- `renderToString` output parses and serializes back identically, except that void elements
  lose their XML-style trailing slash (`<input/>` → `<input>`), as in any HTML serializer.
- Hydration is a page-side concern: ship the client bundle to the browser as usual. If the
  page itself must become interactive inside wasm-quickjs-dom (to run its scripts), load the
  client bundle in the page and hydrate there instead — see the next section.

## Client rendering and hydration inside the page

When the page itself has to run the app — interactive state, timers, the app's own scripts,
or a pipeline (layout, screenshots) that needs the live tree rather than a string — bundle
`react-dom/client` for the page the same way as the server bundle above and drive
`createRoot` / `hydrateRoot` from page code. A complete runnable example that reproduces
every number below is `scripts/guest-react-example.mjs`.

Measured on the same 300-row tree (the app there also carries a click counter, so
interactivity is checked, not assumed):

| Quantity | Measured |
| :--- | ---: |
| Client-only bundle (`react-dom/client`, production) | 704 KiB, eval ≈ 90 ms per page |
| Client + server bundle | 1,244 KiB, eval ≈ 165 ms per page |
| `createRoot` render (flushSync) | ≈ 45 ms |
| Update re-render, every row's text changes | ≈ 40 ms |
| `hydrateRoot` over the `renderToString` markup | ≈ 1 ms to schedule |

What was verified, not just timed:

- The client-rendered tree serializes identically to the `renderToString` output, modulo
  the void-element slash (`<input value="value 0">` vs `<input value="value 0"/>`).
- State works after both a client render and a hydration: a button click increments the
  counter, after hydration exactly as after a fresh render.
- Hydration is incremental, as in a browser: `hydrateRoot` returns after scheduling
  (≈ 1 ms above); the tree hydrates as React's scheduler runs, and an interaction forces
  hydration of the subtree it touches.

Two behavioural notes, both inherited from React rather than from this package:

- State updates queued by a page event are applied when React's scheduler next runs, not
  synchronously inside `dispatchEvent` / `click()`. Code that dispatches an event and
  immediately reads the result can observe the pre-update tree. When a test needs the
  update synchronously, wrap the dispatch in `flushSync` (from `react-dom`), as the
  example does.
- The client render is roughly 2× the `renderToString` time for the same tree — it builds
  the live tree, attaches listeners and keeps state — and roughly 2× faster than driving
  the same render from the host. If the deliverable is only HTML, prerender instead.

## Host-driven rendering: use `transact()` for commits

When React must run on the host — Testing Library suites, user-event, incremental updates
against a live tree — keep `react-dom` as it is, and wrap each synchronous commit in
`transact()` so the mutations queue into one page call instead of crossing one by one, and so
reads interleaved with the writes are answered from the queue where possible:

```ts
dom.transact(() => {
  act(() => {
    root.render(React.createElement(App, { rows: 300 }));
  });
});
```

Wrap the whole synchronous `act(...)` call, not just `root.render(...)`: React schedules the
commit inside `act`, so a wrapper that returns before `act` flushes contains nothing. See the
README's "Transactions" section for the exact semantics.

What to expect: `transact()` buys no speed over the plain commit. Updates take about the same
time, and a mount of 3,000 new items is 10–20% slower, because the plain commit's common writes
go straight to the C DOM while the queue is applied by the page's own script. Its value is the
semantics above (one page call per commit, reads answered from the queue). It gets there because
a commit is applied in as few page calls as it can be: node creation, tree and attribute calls,
state-only property writes and `on…` handler assignments are queued, and the queue is applied
only when something needs the page's answer. Whatever cannot be queued (a method that returns a
page value, a property read the queue cannot answer) applies the queue first, so a commit that
interleaves many such reads pays for each of them with a page call — measure before assuming a
win. Updates of an existing tree read child nodes (`firstChild`, `lastChild`) of nodes the
host has not seen change, and each such read is a page call in either mode.
